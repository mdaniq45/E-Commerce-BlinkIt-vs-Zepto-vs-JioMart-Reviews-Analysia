                recently I got a used item and when I talked to support team
                they keep asking me for clearer image of product although the
                image was perfectly fine. They is no further option for help. I
                can't tolerate this kind of cheating and also the prices are
                also on higher side, compare to others.",blinkit

                no other quick delivery agent in my area so I can't compare. I
                would have given 4 star but 1 star is because of the frustration
                for whenever there is an issue, you would end up getting
                frustrated with the customer care. Not really ""caring"" for their
                customers. But anyway, I'm stuck with them since I'm have no
                option to switch to someone else.",blinkit

                some electronic products that arrived faulty. I’ve been trying
                to reach customer support, but my chat sessions keep getting
                disconnected with the message, ""we are currently experiencing a
                high volume of queries."" Initially, I thought it was a one-time
                issue, but after 3-4 attempts, I received the same response. I
                then checked on my other, less expensive orders and found that
                customer care was readily available. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS AP",blinkit
5,29 August 2024,"I've been using Blinkit for a while now, and it has become my
                go-to app for grocery shopping. The app is well-designed, easy
                to navigate, and offers a wide range of products. The best part?
                Super quick delivery, often within minutes! However, one area
                where Blinkit could take a leaf out of Swiggy's book is the
                delivery charges. While I appreciate the speed, the added
                delivery fee cn sometimes make small purchase option or a
                membership model like instamart would definitely elevate the
                experience",blinkit

                cancelled my order with 'items are out of stock' which was not
                earlier,the refund would be after 6 days and there is no room

                punctual delivery and absolutely safe and quick transactions.

                resolved within 24 hours. However, even after three days,
                there’s been no resolution. To make matters worse, they closed
                the ticket without resolving the issue, and now I can’t raise

                out of stock and were not delivered. Upon receiving the order, I
                noticed that certain items were missing, which was not initially
                communicated. I had to raise a complaint to address the issue

                deliver. Then why advertise Grocery in 10 minutes ? If you are
                taking a surcharge, then deliver in 10 mins, else don't charge
                extra. I feel this App is useful only on those days when I am

1,29 November 2024,"Review: Excessive Delivery Charges on Blinkit I’ve been a
                frequent user of Blinkit, but lately, I’ve noticed the delivery
                charges are becoming excessive. While the app does communicate
                these charges upfront, the amount feels unreasonably high for
                short distances or small orders. It’s discouraging, especially
                for customers who rely on the service for convenience. Blinkit
                should consider revising their pricing model or offering more
                affordable delivery options. High charges can push loyal users",blinkit

                it a replacement or at least refund the money whatsoever, but

                and handling fees, and now you are adding a rush hour charge as

                  cheese slice was also missing in the package because there was

                  something fundamentally wrong which can't be solved? It said

                  problem with jiomart is that for undelivered products they
                  will not refund to original payment method, but to their
                  wallet. Imagine buying a smart phone which is not delivered

                  received half of the order in time and other half after one
                  month approx. 2.Twice they deducted money and my order was
                  placed successfully. On the date of delivery my order was
                  cancelled from Jio Mart. 3. App is too slow. Back button works
                  inconsistently. If you can't cater to the order of customers,
                  please remove app from store rather than wasting their time.

                  services. I'll give you point wise explanation to this: 1.
                  They didn't deliver on time. Don't value for your time, they
                  keep postponing delivery date of their own. 2. They didn't
                  even deliver your complete order. You keep waiting for your
                  order whole week, but you got almost 30% of your ordered items
                  and that too in bad condition. 3. All items shown on their

                  mobile plans& now tripled them years later, ZEPTO is doing
                  exactly the same. I was shocked by discounts at the start, but
                  now there's NOTHING, no discounts. U need to buy random things
                  above ₹999 to get your ₹40 milk packet for ₹39 along with
                  Zepto Pass Super saver(green). You can still choose ₹199 above
                  free with Zepto(violet) but Good luck finding a single rupee

                  Racket refusing to replace or refund the amount. Chatting with
                  their agents takes up a long time as there is a long lull

                  size 10 shoes for ₹1,200, but they don’t fit. Customer service
                  informed me that shoes cannot be returned or exchanged, which

                  sunflower(there is very minor differences between the two and
                  the packet was hidden deep in the bag so i didn't notice at

                  unfortunately, it didn't receive the attention it deserved.
                  The lack of a proper resolution is appalling. If you believe
                  that retaining ₹1,103 is more important than retaining a loyal

                  sent this photos customer care. They said they won't give
                  refund for that. So lost money. If it is bad condition also
                  they won't give any refund. Don't order from this. It's a
                  scam.",zepto

                  of faster delivery is great. It has also started saving me a
                  ton compared to big supermarket after using Zepto Saver. I
                  want this company to thrive and success. Best of Luck !",zepto

                  order, throws around random amounts and jargon to confuse the
                  customer and then has really high delivery charges. Would give
                  this a negative rating if i could",zepto
